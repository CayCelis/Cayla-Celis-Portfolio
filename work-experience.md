# Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering | University of Virginia
## Mechanical Engineering Laboratory Undergraduate Grader	_January 2025 - May 2025_
- Supervised lab section of 13 developing and testing hypotheses on electro-mechanical systems and fluid dynamics. 
- Monitored use of wind tunnels, pressurized & oscillating thrust systems, universal dynamometers, Wheatstone bridge-based strain gauges, cart dynamics. Gave demonstrations of use for each and troubleshot as necessary.
- Held weekly office hours and created lab software guides (e.g., PASCO Capstone) to support student learning.
- Evaluated mechanical engineering knowledge and teamwork through detailed reviews of group presentations and lab reports, supporting career readiness among junior and senior students.
- Improved lab effectiveness by initiating pre-lab practice for TAs, resulting in more organized and efficient sessions.

## Fluid Mechanics Undergraduate Grader	_August 2024 - December 2024_
- Co-developed grading rubrics and evaluated assignments for 84 students, maintaining grading consistency and fairness.

## Li Lab Research Assistant	_February 2024 - August 2024_
- Built Python GUI to batch-process 50+ tensile tests, calculate UTS/strain, & generate stress-strain curves in Excel.
- Independently conducted tensile tests of 50+ recycled plastic/carbon fiber samples to assess mechanical properties.
- Assisted 1D/2D DIC setup to analyze torsion effects on composites in 2+ test sessions.
- Injection-molded 20+ recycled plastic samples to evaluate composite materials for electric vehicle applications.
- Studied ASTM D256 & E143 to understand impact resistance & shear modulus testing for recycled plastic composites.
- Drafted 10+ usability improvement proposals for the lab extrusion machine, detailing benefits and drawbacks of each.
