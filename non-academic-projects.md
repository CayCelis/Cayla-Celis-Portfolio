# Mechatronics and Robotics Society (MARS) – UVA NASA Lunabotics Team	University of Virginia
## Mechanical Team Lead	_May 2024 - May 2025_
- Led 3 separate ~5-person design teams pursuing pre-CDR system design, calculations/analysis, and detailed design. 
- Co-authored grant application for $86,000 5 m x 3 m x 0.5 m lunar-simulant testing arena. Cooperated with Environment Health & Safety (EHS) to reduce arena hazards. Delivered pitch to grant board of 65, securing funding.
- Created regolith arena floor plan and drawing. Ran FEA on simplified arena model to understand static external loads.
- Launched and managed R&D team — created timeline, tracked dust-related triboelectricity studies.
- Developed and taught SOLIDWORKS lesson plans to 20+ new members on part design, mating, and linear patterns.
- Oversaw manufacturing and testing by coordinating 15–20 members and tracking progress and unit testing results

## Systems Engineering Lead	_May 2023 - May 2024_
- Established Systems Engineering Lead role before 2023–2024 season; defined duties and scope from ground up.
- Served as primary author of 27-page systems engineering report, resulting in 17.5% score improvement over previous.
- Led 3 design reviews—System Requirements Review, Preliminary Design Review, & Critical Design Review.
- Derived initial requirements and allocated them across systems hierarchy; refined through stakeholder collaboration.

## Executive Officer	_May 2022 - May 2025_
- Maintained operational continuity by managing elections and onboarding new leadership.
- Strengthened team culture through events and internal communications. Wrote grants and year-end reports.


## Mechanical Team Member	_September 2021 - May 2025_
- CAD-ed parts/assemblies with parametric design and configurations for electronics protection. Proficient in  SOLIDWORKS Sheet Metal and CAD PDM software to manage large assemblies. Delegated to 15-20.
