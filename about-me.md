title: About Me
---

My name is Cayla, and I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Virginia (Go Hoos!).

During my four years, I fell in love with solving meaningful challenges as an engineer, from designing berm-building lunar rovers for simulating in-situ resource utilization during Artemis missions to creating batch-processing Python programs for supporting electric vehicle applications. I hope to continue solving meaningful engineering challenges by obtaining both higher education and hands-on industry experience to pursue R&D within the manufacturing and robotics industries.

In my professional and personal life, I strive to always:
* Keep learning.
* Improve what needs to be improved.
* Practice sustainability.
* Make a positive difference whereever I am.

If you would like to request my resume and/or chat with me further, please reach me at ccelis.mail@gmail.com. Thanks for stopping by!
