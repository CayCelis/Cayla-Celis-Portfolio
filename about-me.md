title: About Me

My name is Cayla, and I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Virginia (Go Hoos!).

I hope to obtain both higher education and hands-on industry experience to pursue R&D within the manufacturing and robotics industries.
