title: About Me
---

My name is Cayla, and I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Virginia (Go Hoos!).

During my four years, I fell in love with solving meaningful challenges as an engineer, from designing berm-building lunar rovers for simulating in-situ resource utilization during Artemis missions to creating batch-processing Python programs for supporting electric vehicle applications. I hope to continue solving meaningful engineering challenges by obtaining both higher education and hands-on industry experience to pursue R&D within the manufacturing and robotics industries.
